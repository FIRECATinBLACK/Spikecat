BUGS & ISSUES:
- Sometimes bodyparts start to disappear and generally physics objects stop rendering correctly. Seems to be a rare occurance, if caused once will happen frequently until game restarts. Cause unknown, assumed to be either with lung issues (jumping in water) or slugbase itself. Needs further investigation
- Sometimes the menu art goes black. Cause unknown, needs further investigation

FIXED BUGS:
- Breath bar doesnt fill entirely
